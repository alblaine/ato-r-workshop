This is the software we will be using to create our documents. \n\nYou must [install R](https://www.r-project.org/) before installing RStudio.\n\n## Required R packages\n\n* [rmarkdown](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) - R package that converts R Markdown documents into a variety of formats. Based on pandoc. Already included with RStudio.\n* knitr - R package that generates dynamic reports. Combines a bunch of packages into one tool. Already included with RStudio.\n* pandoc - R package for converting documents from one markup format to another. Included in RStudio.\n* LaTeX (for PDFs) - software not included, must be installed separately. Typesetting system designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.\n    * MacTeX (Mac)\n    * MiKTeX (Windows)\n\n[More information](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40563479/relationship-between-r-markdown-knitr-pandoc-and-bookdown) about how these packages work together\n\n## Types of documents you create:\n- HTML files / websites\n- PDF\n- Microsoft Word \n- Interactive documents (Shiny apps)\n- Slide presentations\n- Books\n- Journal articles\n- etc\n\n## Slide with Embedded Code\n\n```{r mtcars, echo = TRUE}\nhead(mtcars, 5)\n```\n\n## Slide with Graph\n\n```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5}\nattach(mtcars)\nplot(wt, mpg, main=\"Scatterplot Example\", \n  \txlab=\"Car Weight \", ylab=\"Miles Per Gallon \", pch=19)  \n```\n\n## R Markdown\nR Markdown is a version of Markdown, a text markup tool, adapted for use in R. It's a simpler and more efficient markup language than HTML.\n\nAn R Markdown file is just a text file saved as .Rmd. \n\nYou can use a single R Markdown file to...\n\n* save and execute code (written in R, Python, etc)\n* generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience (with knitr)\n\nR Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.\n\n[Examples from the R Markdown Gallery](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)\n\n\n## How it works\n\nAn R Markdown file is the file that you will use to create your document. \n\nYou can create this file in the RStudio editor, run it and generate the document using the Knit button.\n\nR Markdown files have extension (.Rmd)\n\nA typical file has three components:\n\n- header \n- R code chunks\n- text\n\n## Example R Markdown File\n![](images/example.png)\n\nThe arrows on the right let you run each code chunk. \n\nR Markdown formatting tells the software how to format the text and whether to display/run the code.\n\n\n## Header \n\n![](images/header.png)\n\nWritten in YAML, a format common for configuration files\n\nTitle is whatever you want to title it\n\noutput options (choose one): \nhtml_document, pdf_document, word_document, md_document, ioslides_presentation, slidy_presentation, beamer_presentation\n\nYou can change the output file format just by changing this one line of code.\n\n## Code chunks \n\nMake a code chunk with 3 backticks then {r}. \nEnd chunk with 3 backticks:\n\n![](images/chunk.png)\n\n## Text\nFormatting text requires R Markdown notation. See R Markdown Reference Guide for more examples.\n\n![](images/markdown.png)\n\nnormal text\n\n*italics*\n\n**bold**\n\n[hyperlink example](http://www.ncsu.edu)\n\n## Markdown Tutorial\n\nThis short exercise is to familiarize you with the basics of Markdown. \n\nComplete lessons 1-10 at [www.markdown-tutorial.com](http://www.markdown-tutorial.com)\n\n\n## Rendering your R Markdown file into a document\n\nSave your .Rmd file, and click the *\"Knit\"* button that appears above the file.\n\nYou can set certain output options by clicking on the gear icon next to the Knit button.\n\n![](images/render.png)\n\n## Practice: Create an R Markdown file \noutput type: html_document\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Open RStudio\n2. Files > New Folder\n3. Create a folder called \"RDocsWorkshop\"\n4. Set as working directory (Click \"More\" > \"Set as Working Directory\")\n5. File > New File > R Markdown\n6. Select HTML\n7. Title it \"HelloWorld\"\n8. Click the save button. Save as \"HelloWorld\"\n9. Click \"Knit Html\" to see it render as an HTML file\n10. Change \"Knit Html\" using the dropdown to Knit to Word\" to convert it to a Microsoft Word file\n\n## Chunk options\n\nUsing chunk options, you can set rules for your code chunks. Use cases:\n\n* to specify the dimensions of a figure\n* to make it so a code chunk does not appear in the final document\n* to not run the code in the code chunk\n* to not display error messages generated by the code\n\nSee [R Markdown reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) for more examples! \n\n## Example 1: \n\n{r echo=TRUE}\n\n```{r echo=TRUE}\nplot(wt, mpg, main=\"Scatterplot Example\", \n  \txlab=\"Car Weight \", ylab=\"Miles Per Gallon \", pch=19)  \n```\n\n## Example 2: \n\n{r echo=FALSE}\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nplot(wt, mpg, main=\"Scatterplot Example\", \n  \txlab=\"Car Weight \", ylab=\"Miles Per Gallon \", pch=19)  \n```\n\n## How to set global Chunk Options\n\nThese provide rules for all of the chunks in the document. \n\nExample:\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3)\n\n![](images/example.png)\n\n## Activity\n\n1. Knit HelloWorld.Rmd\n\n2. Change line 9 in your HelloWorld.Rmd file to the following:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\n\n3. Knit the file. Examine the output. What has changed?\n\n4. Now Change line 9 to \n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)\n\n5. Knit the file. What has changed?\n\n6. Change line 9 to \n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)\n\n## Practice: Edit the text \n\n1. Delete boilerplate text and code chunks (lines 12 to the end)\n\n2. Give the document a new title: \"Measuring Nile Flow\" in the header\n\n3. Create an R code chunk\n\nInside your code chunk should be two commands: \n\nlibrary(MASS)  #this loads the MASS library of sample datasets\n``` {r}\nlibrary(MASS)\n```\n\nhead(Nile) #shows the first row of the data set\n``` {r}\nhead(Nile)\n```\n\n## Practice: Add a Plot\n\nAdd a plot below your head(Nile) code. \n\nplot(Nile)\n```{r}\nplot(Nile)\n```\n\n## Practice: Resize the Plot\n\n{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5}\n\nplot(Nile)\n```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=5}\nplot(Nile)\n```\n\n## Add text to the document\n\nThis is a dataset of the annual flow (in $m^3$) of the Nile River at Aswan from 1871–1970.\n\n*To activate LaTeX typsetting, put dollar signs $ before and after m^3\n\n## Convert to Word Doc or PDF\n\nIt's easy to convert your HTML file to a PDF or Word document. Simply click the dropdown arrow next to Knit to HTML and choose a different document type. \n\n## Templates\n\nThere are existing R Markdown templates for html files, slide shows and scholarly journal article formats, to name a few. \n\nExamples:\n\n* [tufte](http://rstudio.github.io/tufte/) is a template for handouts in the style of Edward Tufte.\n\n* [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) is an LaTeX academic journal R package. \n\nTo use a template, you must install the template package: \n\ninstall.packages(\"rticles\", type = \"source\")\n\n## Opening a Template in RStudio\n\nOnce you have installed the rticles package: \n\nFile > New File > R Markdown... \n\nSelect \"From Template\"\n\nThe window should populate with templates from the rticles package\n\nNote: a *full installation of LaTeX is required* for this to work. \n\n## Convert Your Document to a Slide Presentation\n\nPandoc will allow you to convert your html file into a slide presentation. \n\nHere are some slide presentation types you can create in RStudio: \n\n* ioslides_presentation\n* slidy_presentation\n* Beamer (PDF output) - requires a LaTex installation\n* RevealJS - requires installing the \"revealjs\" package\n\nIn the header of HelloWorld.Rmd, change output type to \"slidy_presentation\" and knit the document \n\n## Styling your Slides \n\n* You can add a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) file to your project if you want to change the styling of your Slide presentation. \n* The CSS file must be included in your project directory and named in the header.\n![](images/css.png)\n* You can also specify presentation size and text size in the header. \n* Beamer only renders slides in PDF. [Lots of themes](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Beamer#/Themes_and_colorthemes) are available.\n\nFor more information, see the [documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-11.html)\n\n## Creating an interactive web application with Shiny\n\nShiny is an R framework for creating interactive web applications.\n\nShiny applications are usually two files \n\n",
